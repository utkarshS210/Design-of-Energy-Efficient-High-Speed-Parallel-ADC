# Design-of-Energy-Efficient-High-Speed-Parallel-ADC
I designed an energy-efficient high-speed parallel ADC using Cadence Virtuoso. The project aimed to achieve low power and high-speed conversion for sensor and communication systems. We optimized CMOS comparators, encoders, and logic blocks, achieving low delay, high accuracy, and minimal power.
